          There has been a global trend for static sites in recent few years. I have been lucky to recognize that trend and started to learn more about it back in 2017.<br>I have build more than a few static site using <b>Jekyll</b>, <b>Hugo</b>, <b>Hexo</b>, and <b>11ty</b>, like <a href="/portfolio/westwing/">Westwing</a>, <a href="/portfolio/dominodatalab/">Domino Data Lab</a>, and <a href="/portfolio/hanhanxue/">Han Han Xue</a>.

          WordPress is still number 1 framework for building sites in the world.

          Did you know that Google penalizes sites which are not very performant? For that reason, it is important have a fast site that follow the latest best practices, like Core Web Vitals. I have been optimizing PageSpeed score for several sites, including my own.
