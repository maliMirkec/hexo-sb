    paragraphs:
      - We've worked with Silvestar on several projects, and he's been a pleasure to work with on all of them. Recently, he handled primary front end development for two large web sites that were launched on Adobe Experience Manager. He's also worked on the front end development of a large WordPress project as well as some smaller campaign landing page and microsite work.
      - In all cases, Silvestar's been a breeze to work with. Communication is easy, and he's happy to be part of a larger team, attend regular standups, stay in close communication electronically, etc. (a key factor when working across countries/time zones).
      - His approach to front end development is modern, but he still knows how to debug for Internet Explorer and handle browser-specific issues. He's a thorough tester and has a great eye for detail.
      - Additionally, he's very fast. We were always impressed with the speed at which he could put things together at a very high level of quality.
      - I'd happily work with Silvestar again, and we'll definitely reach out to him in the future when we need help with additional projects.
