I'm currently looking for a new gig, [contact me](/hire-me/) if you need help on your project.
If you want to know which devices and tools I use in my everyday tasks, [read about it here](/uses/).

Many of the aforementioned services are used when I was building this website. I wrote an article about it: ["How I built this website"](/how/).
