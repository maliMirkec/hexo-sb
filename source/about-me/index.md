I am Silvestar Bistrović, fearless web developer, [JAMstack](//jamstack.org/) enthusiast, Wordpress coder, and blog writer.

[Hexo](//hexo.io/), [Middleman](//middlemanapp.com/), [Netlify](//www.netlify.com/), [Cloudflare](//www.cloudflare.com/), [Cloudinary](//cloudinary.com/), [Gulp](//gulpjs.com/), [Webpack](//webpack.js.org/), and [Git](//git-scm.com/) are just part of my JAMstack skill set.

Besides pixel-perfect design, my focus is on performance. Projects I manage have high scores on page speed testing tools.

I am working as a freelance web developer at [Toptal](//www.toptal.com/resume/silvestar-bistrovic#trust-nothing-but-brilliant-freelancers).

If you want to get in touch, [contact me](https://silvestar.typeform.com/to/p8HdMq) or [a tweet](twitter.com/malimirkeccita).
