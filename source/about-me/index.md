I am Silvestar Bistrović, fearless web engineer, CSS developer, [JAMstack](//jamstack.org/) enthusiast, and WordPress theme specialist.

I enjoy creating pixel-perfect, responsive, and modern websites. My focus is on delivering the best experience for users on every device. Making faster, lighter, and more secure sites using WordPress or Static Page Generators is my speciality.

I started my career in a local web development company where I have been working as a backend PHP developer. My career took a turn when I began to work for a local startup as a frontend developer. In spring of 2017, I began to work remotely as a freelance web developer from my office in Osijek, Croatia. I enjoy every aspect of my remote career since.

When I am not coding, I like to write new articles on my blog.
