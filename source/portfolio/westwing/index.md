      - It was a pleasure to work with Silvestar. He was available on a short notice, he closely collaborated with the PM on the project and delivered it on time with good quality. I would work with him again, and actually we are considering to kick off our next project with him.

      - While working a senior Product Manager at Westwing Home & Living, I had the pleasure to hire Silvestar to build our static corporate website. The project went very smoothly and was delivered on time. Communication with Silvestar was straightforward, clear and reliable. He was also very resourceful and what he didn't know he figured out on his own. I would definitely recommend him for static web solutions and other web front-end projects.
