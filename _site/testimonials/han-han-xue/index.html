<p>I collaborated closely with Silvestar on a project.</p>
<p>Throughout the span of the project, Silvestar was able to consistently meet if not exceed expectations. He has the impressive ability to not only readily undertake direct requests, but also intuitively distill ambiguous asks in order to execute solves in a self-sufficient manner.</p>
<p>Silvestarâ€™s can-do attitude and palpable passion for the work combined with his extended knowledge makes for a highly effective problem solver who always strives to provide the best solutions.</p>
<p>If you aim for not only high standard in the result but also elegance in the process, then I would highly recommend considering Silvestar for your project.</p>
