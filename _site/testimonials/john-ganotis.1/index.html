<p>Silvestar is amazing. He is fast, and the work he produces is among the highest quality work I've seen from front-end engineers.</p>
<p>In our time working together he's been extremely reliable, with quick daily calls to give progress updates, but also having flexibility to work independently and provide updates on his progress on days when we skip those calls.</p>
<p>When working with Silvestar, I know that the work will be done quickly and correctly, but that he'll also point out any areas where he thinks we can improve. He's always looking out for opportunities to improve performance, maintainability, and accessibility. I get the impression that he's constantly learning and reflecting on his work, always looking for ways that he can build his skillset even more and produce even higher quality work (if that's possible!).</p>

<li>While working a senior Product Manager at Westwing Home &amp; Living, I had the pleasure to hire Silvestar to build our static corporate website. The project went very smoothly and was delivered on time. Communication with Silvestar was straightforward, clear and reliable. He was also very resourceful and what he didn't know he figured out on his own. I would definitely recommend him for static web solutions and other web front-end projects.</li>

<li>I collaborated closely with Silvestar on a project.</li>
<li>Throughout the span of the project, Silvestar was able to consistently meet if not exceed expectations. He has the impressive ability to not only readily undertake direct requests, but also intuitively distill ambiguous asks in order to execute solves in a self-sufficient manner.</li>
<li>Silvestarâ€™s can-do attitude and palpable passion for the work combined with his extended knowledge makes for a highly effective problem solver who always strives to provide the best solutions.</li>
<li>If you aim for not only high standard in the result but also elegance in the process, then I would highly recommend considering Silvestar for your project.&quot;</li>

<li>We've worked with Silvestar on several projects, and he's been a pleasure to work with on all of them. Recently, he handled primary front end development for two large web sites that were launched on Adobe Experience Manager. He's also worked on the front end development of a large WordPress project as well as some smaller campaign landing page and microsite work.</li>
<li>In all cases, Silvestar's been a breeze to work with. Communication is easy, and he's happy to be part of a larger team, attend regular standups, stay in close communication electronically, etc. (a key factor when working across countries/time zones).</li>
<li>His approach to front end development is modern, but he still knows how to debug for Internet Explorer and handle browser-specific issues. He's a thorough tester and has a great eye for detail.</li>
<li>Additionally, he's very fast. We were always impressed with the speed at which he could put things together at a very high level of quality.</li>
<li>I'd happily work with Silvestar again, and we'll definitely reach out to him in the future when we need help with additional projects.</li>
