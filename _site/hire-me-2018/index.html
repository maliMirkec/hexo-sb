<h2>Why me</h2>
<p>I've been working with web technologies since 2011. I first started as a PHP developer in 2012. We were a small team of 2 and we worked on various projects like:</p>
<ul>
<li>building custom CMS for websites;</li>
<li>building custom CRM solutions;</li>
<li>building application for a call center;</li>
<li>building websites for local companies;</li>
<li>and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this time I started to work with front-end technologies, especially with CSS and jQuery. Although jQuery was fun to play with, I always preferred HTML and CSS. Creating new user interface was and still is my primary passion. But at that time I had to do that by using float grid system. Luckily enough, Bootstrap was invented and we were saved. Soon after that preprocessors gained in popularity, I had to learn how to use them. We started with AngularJS as well. Then I realized that I'm not enjoying working with PHP as much as I enjoy working with front-end technologies.</p>
<p>In 2015, I was lucky enough to find a new job. I became a front-end developer in a big local firm with a global market. We were working on an enterprise dairy industry application. We worked in teams and my job was to create pages for a web application. In order to this more efficiently, I've built a styleguide. With a little help of my front-end colleagues, we created a maintainable architecture for both the application and the styleguide. We were working with JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS. I really learned a lot from that experience.</p>
<p>In 2015 friends asked me to build a website. They were starting with their <a href="https://irinaandmatej.com">wedding photography business</a>. Back then I was ambitious (and stupid) enough and I was trying to build my own CSM solution from scratch. I succeeded but I was the only person who was able to use it. When friends needed a new blog post, I had to do it. It wasn't the perfect solution, but I was proud. And I'm glad I went down that road because I learned a lot. The biggest lesson was the most obvious one: Please stop reinventing the wheel, Silvestar!</p>
<p>In 2016 I wanted to start my own blog. It was my great desire for a long time but I was afraid. But fear isn't necessarily the bad thing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And it happened, I started a blog. I used WordPress as a blogging engine. I always work with performance on my mind so I tried to make my blog as fast as possible. I managed to create a pretty fast website using <a href="/articles/bem-wordpress-theme/">_bem - WordPress theme with BEM methodology</a>. As icing on the cake, the content from my website got recognized and even featured on CSS Weekly: <a href="http://css-weekly.com/issue-237/">Issue #237</a>, <a href="http://css-weekly.com/issue-258/">Issue #258</a>, and <a href="http://css-weekly.com/issue-277/">Issue #277</a>.</p>
<p>My WordPress project was successful and I wanted to create the same experience for my photographer friends. We switched to WordPress and I created a beautiful new theme from scratch. The performance of the site was good enough. More importantly, now friends could publish the content by themselves.</p>
<p>In 2017 I was still working on my regular job. And then in February, the company was shut down. That was a huge shock. After the notice period expired, I've applied for <a href="https://www.toptal.com/#trust-nothing-but-brilliant-freelancers">Toptal</a> and became a <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/silvestar-bistrovic#trust-nothing-but-brilliant-freelancers">Toptaler</a>. In May I founded a new company, <a href="https://www.cita.hr">Cita d.o.o</a>. During this period I was learning about <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">static page generators</a>. I decided it was time to switch my blog to <a href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a>. I wrote an article about <a href="/how/">how I built this website</a>.</p>
<p>My first job on Toptal was to build static pages for a <a href="https://www.contiamo.com/">German based company</a>. I really enjoyed working on that gig. The team was fantastic and we built several pages using SVG, Sass, Webpack, and Yarn, to list the most important ones. And we built a styleguide. I think it is important to have a styleguide both for designers and developers. It was a great challenge to build this kind of website because it looks so simple, yet it is not simple at all.</p>
<p>I've worked on all sorts of projects and I'm still learning new technologies and techniques every day. I love my job and I like to think that I'm good at it. At least I'm trying to be.</p>
<p>Until this day I've learned to deal with many different problems and tasks. You could check which <a href="/services/">services</a> I could provide for you.</p>
<p>Best,
Silvestar</p>
