<h2>Github Atom installation</h2>
<p><a href="https://atom.io/">Github Atom</a> is my first choice text editor. I know that there are faster and more stable text editor out there, but I prefer open source solutions.</p>
<p>To install Github Atom, go to <a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a> and download the installer. If you're like me and you prefer latest features, you could use beta version by visiting <a href="https://atom.io/beta">https://atom.io/beta</a>.</p>
<h2>First package</h2>
<p>After you've installed Atom, you should install your first packageâ€”<strong><a href="https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings">sync-settings</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>sync-settings</strong> is used to synchronize almost all of your editor's settings. It is a very good starting point when you're reinstalling Atom or installing Atom on a different device. It saved me plenty of time back in the day.</p>
<h3>sync-settings installation</h3>
<p>First, open Atom settings. I'm a Windows user and default shortcut for Windows is <code>ctrl-,</code>. Go to <em>Install</em>, make sure you're on <em>Packages</em> tab, type in &quot;sync-settings&quot; and press <em>Enter.</em></p>
<p>To install <strong>sync-settings</strong>, find package in a list (should be first on the list) and then click <em>Install</em> button.</p>

<h3>sync-settings configuration</h3>
<p><em>To configure <strong>sync-settings</strong>, you should have <a href="https://github.com/">Github account</a>. If you don't have one already, create a new one, it's free.</em></p>
<p>After you've installed <strong>sync-settings</strong> package, click on <em>Settings</em>. In order to make your first backup, you should fill <em>Personal Access Token</em> and <em>Gist Id</em>. If you're not familiar with this terms, please refer to <a href="https://atom.io/packages/sync-settings"><strong>sync-settings</strong> Setup section</a>.</p>

<h3>sync-settings usage</h3>
<p>Now, you should make your first backup.</p>
<p>Open <a href="https://atom.io/packages/command-palette">command palette</a> by pressing <code>ctrl-shift-p</code>, enter &quot;sync-settings&quot;, select <em>Sync Settings: Backup</em> and press <em>Enter</em>.</p>

<p>You've successfully created your first Atom settings backup.</p>
<p><em>Whenever you install new package, edit or add new snippet or change shortcut, don't forget to make a backup of your settings.</em></p>
<p>If you have Atom installed on different device, <strong>sync-settings</strong> package should prompt you to restore your latest settings. That way you're always in sync.</p>
