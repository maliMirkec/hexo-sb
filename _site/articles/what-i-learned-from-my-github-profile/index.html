<p>GitHub profile is often recognised as a developer‚Äôs portfolio. It reveals how often do you contribute, and what kind of projects do you like. But what else could we discover from a GitHub profile? Here is what I learned.</p>
<p><em>This analysis doesn't include repositories from my clients.</em></p>
<h2>GitHub profile</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/starbist/image/upload/w_720,q_100/v1571392266/GitHub_profile_Contribution_activity_graph_ridiqj.gif" alt="&quot;Contribution activity graph on my GitHub profile.&quot;"></p>
<p>Here are some facts from <a href="https://github.com/maliMirkec">my Contribution activity graph</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I commit a lot.</li>
<li>I commit often.</li>
<li>I produced more than 7 commits per day in the last year.</li>
<li>I produced almost 10 commits per day in 2018.</li>
<li>I started with remote work in June 2017.</li>
<li>I had two notable working gaps while struggling to find a gig: first one in autumn of 2017, the second one in spring of 2018.</li>
<li>I had only one week without a single contribution this year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sourcerer</h2>
<p>Sourcerer is an open-source project that gives a visual overview of your GitHub profile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúSourcerer is a visual profile for SWEs that analyzes and derives your abilities, preferences, and habits from your commits and source code.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some facts from <a href="https://sourcerer.io/malimirkec">my Sourcerer profile</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I produced more than 3k commits.</li>
<li>I wrote more than 1,8 million lines of code.</li>
<li>I wrote more than 1,5 million lines of CSS.</li>
<li>I wrote more than 90k lines of JS.</li>
<li>I wrote only 1,7 lines of jQuery.</li>
<li>I wrote more than 64k lines of HTML.</li>
<li>I wrote more than 8k lines of PHP.</li>
<li>I practised Gulp as a tool the most.</li>
<li>I practised pug as a template engine the most.</li>
<li>I was most productive during the day.</li>
<li>I wrote the code during the weekend.</li>
<li>I favour spaces for indentation.</li>
<li>I favour the camelcase for variables.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>I came to a few conclusions based on facts from my GitHub profile:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I work too much</strong>. I work on weekends. According to Sourcerer, I am most active on Sundays. üò±</li>
<li><strong>More than 90% of my code is CSS</strong>. I must be a <em>real</em> CSS developer. üíØ</li>
<li><strong>Coding is my hobby</strong>. Although this analysis doesn't include my paid engagements, it says how much I like to spend my free time. I spend my free time writing code. ü§î</li>
</ol>
<p>Although this information is intimidating, I do not think I work too much. I mean, I work much, but I enjoy doing it.</p>
<p>Happy coding, everyone!</p>
