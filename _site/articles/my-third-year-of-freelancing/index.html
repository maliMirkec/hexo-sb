<p>It is time for another yearly overview of my freelancing career: the third year.</p>
<p>You could read the report on my <a href="/articles/my-first-year-of-freelancing/">first</a> and <a href="/articles/my-second-year-of-freelancing/">second</a> year, too.</p>
<h2>Clients</h2>
<p>During the last year, I have been working with four clients on multiple projects. The clients contacted me via:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/#trust-nothing-but-brilliant-freelancers">Toptal</a>,</li>
<li>recommendations, and</li>
<li>my website.</li>
</ul>
<p>All clients but one had more than one project where they needed my expertise.</p>
<p>Only one client came from Europe, Germany, while others came from the United States. I have a continuous agreement with all my clients. Some clients need my services more often, some only a few times a year. The important thing is that my schedule is almost always full, with very few windows opened for new opportunities.</p>
<h2>Tasks and Assignments</h2>
<p>The tasks for the last year could be summarized in two main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>user interface development, and</li>
<li>page speed optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>User interface development assumes the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>building and maintaining styleguides,</li>
<li>developing reusable components,</li>
<li>creating layouts and templates,</li>
<li>converting designs to pages, and</li>
<li>creating user interface animations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Page speed optimizations assume the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimizing CSS delivery by extracting Critical CSS and purifying the unused CSS code,</li>
<li>optimizing JavaScript delivery by deferring and optimizing the JavaScript code,</li>
<li>minifying the code, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript,</li>
<li>optimizing and compressing images,</li>
<li>optimizing font delivery, and</li>
<li>improving scores by applying the best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realized that I don’t have a preference for technology stack. I have been working on the following stacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress/WPengine,</li>
<li>Shopify,</li>
<li>Jekyll/Netlify/Netlify CMS, and</li>
<li>Hugo/Netlify/Netlify CMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the project is frontend related, I am quite positive I could work on it as long as it is not a JavaScript-heavy application.</p>
<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<p>Last year I published two side projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Line Daily, and</li>
<li>The UI Development Mentoring Program.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cld.silvestar.codes/">Code Line Daily</a> is a website dedicated to a single line of code that produces stunning results. The lines are mostly PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code. It is also available as a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-line-daily/jfgojeolhopchbgfdgodicnaimmkbpbg">Chrome extension</a>, and it has an open API, which I used to develop a small widget on my <a href="/">homepage</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I am getting older, I appreciate the time away from the computer more, and I am trying to work on side projects only during my “office time”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://mentor.silvestar.codes/">The UI Development Mentoring Program</a> is a new initiative in which I am trying to help beginners to get better in UI development. Besides the mentoring part, you could find other useful sources on the site, like <a href="https://mentor.silvestar.codes/resources">learning resources</a> and <a href="https://mentor.silvestar.codes/reads">daily reads</a>. You could <a href="https://mentor.silvestar.codes/reads#newsletter">subscribe to the newsletter</a>, too. The newsletter contains hand-picked frontend and UI articles and tools.</p>
<p>I am still maintaining my other projects like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/starter-project">Starter Project</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/starter-project-cli">Starter Project CLI</a>. I am utilizing these to make development easier for myself on both client’s and personal projects, no matter which platform is in use.</p>
<p>Working on side projects is like a hobby for me. I like to get away from the client’s projects and play around with my projects instead. As I am getting older, I appreciate the time away from the computer more, and I am trying to work on side projects only during my “office time”.</p>
<h2>Remote working</h2>
<p>Having multiple clients at the same time could often involve difficulties with time management and organization. It is essential to organize your time, but there is one other critical aspect: <em>communication</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever I start a new engagement, I tend to communicate the preferred way of working on a project. It is vital to establish trust from the very beginning. That way, my clients know all about my working habits and my preferred method of working.</p>
<p>For example, I like to establish an agreement that all tasks will be resolved within 24 hours period. If I am blocked within that time, I usually send my client an email or a message announcing what is blocking me—that way, the client respects my time and could plan tasks according to my schedule.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Another example of honest communication is when one client decides to do a significant update or a whole new project. In that case, I inform all other clients that my availability will be decreased for that period. That is often communicated at least a couple of weeks in advance. Again, other clients usually respect my availability and plan the tasks accordingly.</p>
<p>I never hide the fact that I am working with other clients. I am always very open, and all my clients respect that. If I have a problem or concern, I usually communicate it very early because I want to resolve it sooner rather than later.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>During the last year, I got a significant amount of job offers, and I rejected a lot of them. Some proposals came via professional networks like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/starbist/">LinkedIn</a>, and some came directly from my site.</p>
<p>There are two significant reasons for rejecting an offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>uneducated recruiters who don’t understand my profile and skillset,</li>
<li>client disagreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first reason lies in the fact that recruiters are not adequately educated about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">the Great (Frontend) Divide</a>. I understand that React is a hot requirement these days and everybody works with it, but I don’t.</p>
<p>I don’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop applications,</li>
<li>use React,</li>
<li>use TypeScript, or</li>
<li>think React nor TypeScript should on every job posting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop websites,</li>
<li>use Vanilla JavaScript, and</li>
<li>think React is overused.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I like to think that I am fair, and I give every client a chance to convince me why I should work on their project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other reason why I reject proposals is that the client and I are not fit. Here are the most common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not too fond of the project, and</li>
<li>I am not too fond of the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the example of the project I am not too fond of: optimize WordPress site built with page builders.</p>
<p>Here is the example of the client I am not too fond of: could you make a landing page within one day.</p>
<p>Other reasons are mostly disagreements about the rate or estimation.</p>
<p>I like to think that I am fair, and I give every client a chance to convince me why I should work on their project. The problem emerges when the client feels the other way around—that I should persuade him/her to work on their project. When this happens, I know the communication would be the problem, so I avoid these clients.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My third year of freelancing is undoubtedly the most successful one. With my family expanded by a new member, I managed to dedicate my time to work on high-quality projects like <a href="/portfolio/westwing/">Westwing</a>, <a href="/portfolio/creditcardinsider/">Credit Card Insider</a>, <a href="/portfolio/huggable/">Huggable</a> and <a href="/portfolio/dominodatalab/">Domino Data Lab</a>. All thanks to honest and open communication, quality time management and support from my family.</p>
