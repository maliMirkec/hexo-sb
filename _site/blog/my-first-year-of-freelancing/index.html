<p><em>I am writing this article from a frontend developer perspective, as I am one. I have specialized in User Interface, Static Page Generators, WordPress, and page speed optimization.</em></p>
<p>About a year ago, I started with a freelance career. This experience has changed me as a professional, but also as a person.</p>

<h2>Clients</h2>
<p>I am a member of <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/silvestar-bistrovic#trust-nothing-but-brilliant-freelancers">Toptal</a> talent network, and most of my clients are part of this <a href="https://www.toptal.com/#trust-nothing-but-brilliant-freelancers">formidable networks</a> as well. I worked with seven Toptal clients. I also worked with a couple of <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01c831478a40df279f/">Upwork</a> clients. Two of my clients engaged me via my website. I worked as a mentor on <a href="https://www.codementor.io/malimirkeccita">Codementor</a>. I also worked on a couple of projects with my friends, pro bono.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúToptal is a private, elite talent network with thousands of members across 100+ countries. Of the hundreds of thousands who apply each year, fewer than 3% gain admission to the network.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In total, I worked with thirteen clients and seventeen mentees.</p>
<p>Clients came from all over the world: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Romania, and Croatia. Most of them were agencies, but I also worked with designers and developers, too.</p>
<p>In my opinion, investing in the relationship with a client is the most critical part. Earning trust from a remote position is not easy. Being kind could take you a long way with your client, and it doesn't cost you a thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúDuring my first year of freelancing, I didn't have a single negative experience with any client.‚Äù

</blockquote>
<p>Getting the job done is also important. Never promise what you cannot deliver. It is okay to say that you need a couple of hours to do research. It is okay to say that you are not the right person for that task. It depends on a project type and the team.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I worked on various projects last year, mostly on WordPress platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>developed a custom theme for <a href="/portfolio/irinaandmatej/">a wedding photography website</a>,</li>
<li>developed a custom theme for a digital ID validation solution website,</li>
<li>installed a premium theme for <a href="/portfolio/marcijusweddings/">another wedding photography website</a>,</li>
<li>installed a premium theme for <a href="/portfolio/borninjune/">a travel journal website</a>, and</li>
<li>helped a few clients to finish WordPress projects by applying style improvements and making websites responsive.</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a couple of styleguides:</p>
<ul>
<li>one for a WordPress-based website for a large real-estate company, and</li>
<li>other for a website built using static site generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>I developed a few websites using static page generators:</p>
<ul>
<li>a website for an agency from Germany using Middleman framework,</li>
<li><a href="/portfolio/hanhanxue/">a personal website for a designer from Montreal</a> using Middleman, and</li>
<li>a personal website for myself using the Hexo framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have worked on web speed optimization:</p>
<ul>
<li>on WordPress-based projects, and</li>
<li>on <a href="/portfolio/moodings/">a Shopify project</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the spare time, I worked on open-source projects. I published <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-codepen">three</a>¬† <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-caniuse">simple</a>¬† <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-cloudinary">plugins</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-theme-sb">a theme</a> for the Hexo framework, <a href="http://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-dragtable">an Angular directive</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/classily.js">a JavaScript plugin</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/starter-project">a boilerplate of Gulp tasks</a>.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>Not everything is perfect. Freelancing comes with difficulties. Searching for a job is one of the biggest I came across.</p>
<p>Last summer I had a difficult time to find a client. I created new profiles on different hiring networks. I searched on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, AngelList, newsletters, everywhere.</p>
<p>I found out that biding all over the place is a time-consuming and counter-effective process. I caught myself getting responses (negative ones) from clients that I didn't even remember sending. I became nervous and felt terrible about myself. I was feeling more tired of bidding than when I worked on an actual project.</p>
<p>Eventually, I learned that it is better to bid on a couple of places and invest more time in a more quality cover-letter or application. There is enough job for everybody. The key is to find a proper way to get one.</p>
<h2>Lessons</h2>
<p>Working as a freelancer is hard, and it isn't for everyone. Many obstacles are on that way. Here is what I have learned in the last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to manage time more efficiently,</li>
<li>how to become more productive,</li>
<li>how to get away from a computer,</li>
<li>how to decline a job offer, especially if I am not fully qualified for the position,</li>
<li>that saying &quot;I don't know&quot; is OK,</li>
<li>it takes time to find a client,</li>
<li>it takes time to land a client,</li>
<li>it takes time to get paid, and</li>
<li>to be kind to others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am happy to be able to share my experience as a freelance developer. Successful freelancing takes time and patience. Luckily that is something that could be learned along the way.</p>
