<p>Last week I released my side project: <a href="https://cld.silvestar.codes">Code Line Daily</a>.</p>
<p>It is a quite straightforward project: a new line of code would be introduced every day. The lines are mostly frontend, PHP, and WordPress code. Here's how I build it!</p>

<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>To build this project, I have used <a href="https://starter.silvestar.codes">Starter Project</a>. It is a Gulp based boilerplate that I created last year. It has grown a lot, and for this project, I have introduced JSON data files.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;list&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;line&quot;: &quot;all: unset&quot;,
      &quot;note&quot;: &quot;Resets all properties to default.&quot;,
      &quot;link&quot;: &quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all&quot;,
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;CSS&quot;,
      &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Silvestar&quot;,
      &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2019-08-01&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;line&quot;: &quot;overflow: initial&quot;,
      &quot;note&quot;: &quot;Sets overflow to default state.&quot;,
      &quot;link&quot;: &quot;https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/overflow/&quot;,
      &quot;language&quot;: &quot;CSS&quot;,
      &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Silvestar&quot;,
      &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2019-08-02&quot;
    }
  ]
}

<p>Here is the basic JSON structureâ€”an array of object items. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-data">gulp-data</a> plugin is used to include, parse, and display the data on the homepage, archive, and author pages.</p>
<pre><code class="language-pug">- var list = locals.data.list ? locals.data.list.filter(item =&gt; new Date(item.date) &lt; new Date()) : [];
</code></pre>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/maliMirkec/code-line-daily/blob/master/src/html/mixins/variables.pug">See the full code</a>.</em></p>
<p>To display only current lines and not future ones, I have used <code>filter</code> function with a date condition. That way, future lines won't be displayed. Also, I have set up Zapier to trigger a new build every day in the morning.</p>
<pre><code class="language-pug">- thisItem = list.slice(-1).pop()

h3= thisItem.line
</code></pre>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/maliMirkec/code-line-daily/blob/master/src/html/index.pug">See the full code</a>.</em></p>
<p>To display only a single line on the homepage, I have extracted the last item from an array of lines.</p>
<pre><code class="language-pug">ul
  each listValue, listIndex in list.reverse()
    li
      h3= listValue.line
</code></pre>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/maliMirkec/code-line-daily/blob/master/src/html/archive.pug">See the full code</a>.</em></p>
<p>To display the list of lines, I have reversed the array and then iterated over each item using <code>each</code> loop.</p>
<p>The website is hosted on Netlify and powered by Netlify CMS to make my life easier by being able to publish new lines right from the browser.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have enjoyed building this project, and I have a few other ideas on how to reuse the code, but I would leave that for myself for now.</p>
<p>I have learned that I don't need a classic page generator. I could use my Gulp-based generator. What is great about it is that it is packed with a lot of modern techniques and best practices, which saved me much time to develop this project.</p>
<p>If you have an exciting line of code to share, feel free to <a href="https://cld.silvestar.codes/about">contribute</a> to the website. Code Line Daily is an open-source project.</p>
